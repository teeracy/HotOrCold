			<h3>These pandas need your help! They're so dumb that they only consume a food source that their cute, little bodies can't even process. Instead of eating meat like a carnivore should, these adorably stupid creatures eat only bamboo, which is difficult to eat and doesn't even provide much nutrients per volume. Your job is to cook them some delicious bamboo soup! Maybe with your help (as well as the rest of the world), these little guys will survive! </h3>
			<h2>On a scale of 1 to 100, how warm should their soup be?</h2>
